What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
At this point Git creates its folder and is ready to start tracking versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a sort of cache to gather the specific files from the repo/working directory and to create the commit.
